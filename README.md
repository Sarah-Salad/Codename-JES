# Codename-JES

Bark Johnson, and interplanetary mercenary, finds himself crash-landed on the planet of Dram, full of strange alien tribes that interact with Bark throughout his journey. Playing as Bark, the player must find a way to repair their ship with the help of these aliens so that he may continue his mission. The player will start out near the JESian tribe, who will serve as a tutorial to the game’s mechanics. They have to go down four separate paths to acquire each part for the spaceship from the other alien tribes. The four paths are:
The Spoops - a tribe of small humanoids who have the metal required to fix the ship.
The Donyatsu - donut-cat hybrids that horde rocket fuel to prevent global warming.
The Jetbrains - a race of cyborgs that have the tools necessary for the JESians to fix the spaceship.
The Tower - a strange black tower visible from anywhere on the map, full of crazy people from every other tribe. Isn’t fully accessible until all the other parts are acquired. 

Upon acquiring each part, Bark gains new abilities and upgrades like armor, double-jumping, and a torch. All his abilities eventually allow him to enter the Tower and acquire the final part, a blackbox necessary to run the spaceship.
